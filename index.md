Make Jelly site have a GitBook look! Test Hi.

Hi, I’m Chris.

I’m a postdoctoral fellow mentored by Rebekah Gundry at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. My research lies at the interface of biology, liquid chromatrography -mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, where I have developed and applied methods to analyze glycomic and glycoproteomic mass spectrometry data. I received my PhD in 2018 from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, under the direction of Nicolle Packer.
